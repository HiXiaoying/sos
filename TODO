[ ] Replicatione doesn't cover failures.

[x] Blob-Servers don't report on failures.

[x] Return JSON on upload:
     {
       "size" : 9,
       "id" : "f71a75ec560b4d2a86f247d0cd167bf0deb39f85",
       "status" : "OK"
     }

[x] We don't test if a server is alive before using it from the API-server.
